# br_tables

Provides the ability to scrape [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/) tables to create pandas DataFrames. This is a rewrite of the many of the outdated and broken scripts to do this scraping found around the web. Specifically, the newer elements of the Baseball Reference website create require different processing.

Please follow Baseball Reference's terms of service associated with collecting and using the data they host.
